**Overview**

The Render Network Foundation, or the "Foundation", was established to
facilitate the development of the network and support growth initiatives
across the ecosystem. As the sole proprietor of protocol repositories
and major assets crucial to the successful operation of the network, the
Foundation now requires resources in the form of capital and labor to
effectively perform its function.

This proposal outlines a mechanism for the Foundation to acquire
immediate resources, and specifies how these resources can be allocated
by the entity in order to bring product and growth initiatives to
fruition.

**Category**

This is a core proposal within the Ecosystem Fund Allocation category.

**Motivation**

The Foundation is principally responsible for core protocol development,
ecosystem growth activities, and implementing or monitoring approved
proposals via the RNP process. The objective of this proposal is to
equip the Foundation with resources and processes required for it to
fulfill its duties. With a proper resource allocation, the foundation
will be able to achieve its goals and focus on growing the network while
having a clear pathway for allocating said resources.

**Stakeholders**

This proposal impacts all members of the Render Network community, as
well as OTOY Inc, the founders of the Render Network.

**Implementation**

In order for the Foundation to operate as intended, it needs to
*acquire* and then *allocate* resources.

*Acquiring Resources*

RNP-001 defines a supply schedule in which new emissions are distributed
to stakeholders within the network. In production, network governance is
utilized in order to determine the split of emissions as they are
distributed to creators, node operators, liquidity providers, and other
valuable actors.

This proposal advocates that 50% of emissions in Year 1 be allocated to
the Foundation for use as outlined below.

This should be sufficient to equip the foundation to accelerate
execution of its responsibilities, while still ensuring that sufficient
emissions remain for creators, node operators and liquidity providers,
when taking into account

and expected network growth in Year 1.

> During Year 1, monthly emissions are scheduled at 760,567 RNDR tokens.
> Allocating 50% of these tokens to the Foundation would leave 380,283.5
> RNDR tokens per month, or 1,140,850.5 RNDR tokens per quarter. In Q4
> of 2022, less than 200,000 RNDR tokens were distributed to node
> operators. Therefore, even if network demand were to increase fivefold
> during Year 1, there would still be sufficient emissions to adequately
> compensate node operators and other participants. Also note that the
> potential deflationary mechanisms around the buy-and-burn process
> significantly impact unit economics, both under and over 6x network
> demand growth.

Core teams at the Foundation are expected to monitor network utilization
and growth and make adjustments to these quantities over time. Grants
can also be issued to third-parties to support monitoring emissions.

While it will still take some time before the roll-out of the BME model
described in RNP-001 is released and emissions are minted, OTOY Inc. has
agreed that if this RNP-003 is approved, it will provide the Foundation
with an immediate interim loan facility of up to 4.5M RNDR tokens from
its Treasury.

*Allocating Resources*

Once the Foundation has accrued sufficient RNDR tokens in its treasury
to operate, it can allocate these resources via two primary channels:

1.  *Core Team Expansion:* The Foundation will hire product, engineering, design, and growth team members to facilitate network initiatives and RNP directives.

2.  *Grants Programs:* The Foundation will earmark some portion of its treasury for bespoke grants and bounties to support ancillary infrastructure and services necessary for network growth.

Foundation leadership is responsible for each of the above actions, and
must incorporate community input when building and executing against all
product and growth roadmaps.

**Drawbacks**

The Foundation is expected to receive a decreasing amount of RNDR from
emissions over time. This presents two challenges:

1.  Parameter selection for emissions distribution is a complex process, and requires significant forecasting expertise. A Foundation-led team will invest resources in adequate forecasting tools.

2.  The Foundation treasury does not currently have a permanent and sustainable path for consistent RNDR denominated inflows over time.

This requires sophisticated capital management within the organization
and the ability to pivot based on changing resource needs.
