# Render Network Proposals (RNPs)
The Render Network Proposal Repository

**Please read through RNP-000 before constructing your first RNP.** RNPs should be well thought out and discussed across the appropriate Render Network Community channels.

## Guidelines for RNPs

 1. **Members should research previous proposals to ensure that their RNP has not already been submitted or does not conflict with a proposal up for vote.**
 2. **RNPs that conflict with a proposal that is currently up for vote, will only be put up for vote after a significant time has elapsed from when the first proposal was voted on in order to avoid conflicts and wasted effort.**
 3. **RNPs will be removed from consideration if they involve illegal activity, hate speech, pornographic material, or do not represent the mission or values of the Render Network.**
 4. **Technically infeasible RNPs will be removed from consideration during the review period - i.e. a component of the review process is assessing whether RNPs are actionable.**

## Community Principles
* #### *Equality*: It is important that everyone feels like they have a voice no matter their background and however small or large they are. The network is working to bring high end 3D graphics and related digital experiences to anyone with a creative vision.
* #### *Constructiveness*: The network is more than the sum of its parts, and looks for positive contributions to building the future of decentralized GPU computing.
* #### *Transparency*: Decisions will be publicly communicated openly and communication channels will provide open, publicly accessible forums to debate the future of RNPs.
