# Internal Render Network Team Review on RNP-000 (v2)
## Final Results:
***Internal Render Network Team to elevate RNP-000 (v2) to "Live Pending" Status***

### Notes/Comments:

 - Motion to tokengate community channels focused on governance, so that only active Render Network community members and stakeholders can participate in RNP actions. ***General and Informational channels will still be publicly available, enabling the wider public to learn about the Render Network governance process prior to becoming a stakeholder.***
	 - **Rationale**: tokengating could prevent malicious actors or non-token holders from shaping the Render Network in ways that the community does not actually intend to go, or overwhelm the voices of active RNDR stakeholders. 
	- *Motion Seconded for benefits from an operational perspective.*
	
 - Motion to implement an AMA-style community forum for each RNP, moderated by the Render Network mod-team.	
	- **Rationale**: “The RNP-001 v2 AMA showed that communication between RNP authors and the community seems to work well when it’s advertised and can be done live. Definitely some flaws still (potentially hosted on Waitroom or across multiple platforms), but more information is given in real time.”
	
 - From an infrastructure perspective, there are no outlier costs or additional mechanisms needed to be formed within the current structure of the RNP framework, as outlined by RNP-000 v2.
 - From a technical perspective, a cursory knowledge of Markdown language may be needed for RNP construction if Github is to be the primary repository for RNPs. A basic guide to markdown can be found [here](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax), and free markdown editors/exporters can be found at [https://stackedit.io/](https://stackedit.io/) and [https://dillinger.io/](https://dillinger.io/).
